          I was first introduced into programming when I was a kid. I wanted to make my own 
          video game so I used this program called Game Maker 7. After making some basic platformer 
          games, I wanted to transition into first person types of games. This is when I discovered 
          programming. All advanced features required knowledge of c#. I learned c# just well enough 
          to create my very own first fps game. It wasn't until I became an adult when I realized the true 
          potential of software development. If I could spend all my time coding I would. 
          I'm very passionate about programming and I can't wait to start working together.

          I was first introduced into programming when I was a kid. I wanted to make my own video game so I use this program called Game Maker 7. After making some basic platformer games, I wanted to transition into first person type of games. This is when I discovered programming. All advanced features required knowledge on c#. I learned c# just well enough to create my very first fps game.
          It wasn't until I became an adult when I realized the true potential of software development. If I could spend all my time coding I would. I'm very passionate about programming and I can't wait to start working together.

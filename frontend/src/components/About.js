                I was first introduced into programming when I was a kid. I wanted to make my own 
                video game so I used this program called Game Maker 7. All advanced features required knowledge of c#. I learned c# just well enough 
                to create my very own first fps game. It wasn't until I became an adult when I realized the true 
                potential of software development. I'm very passionate about programming and I can't wait to start working together.
